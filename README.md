# Spellcount #

This addon will:
- Let you know if the mob's ability/spell is one you can learn or not (useful for BLUs) by playing a sound. No sound if you've learned it already.
- Let you know if you learned a new spell (useful for BLUs) by playing a sound.
- Let you easily search for spells by job or by name (partial names too) to quickly identify whether you know it or not.

## Syntax ##

Syntax can be obtained by running the command without arguments, or with the subcommand 'help'

Current syntax is:

- sc <JOB>: List all spells missing for that particular job.
- sc trusts: List all non-UC missing trusts.
- sc missing: List all missing spells.
- sc <string>: List all spells that contain that string name and whether we know it or not.

### Examples ###

```
sc WHM
sc minuet
```
